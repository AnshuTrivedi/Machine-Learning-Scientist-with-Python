## Course-1: Supervised Learning with scikit-learn
 In this course, I learnt how to use Python to perform supervised learning. I learnt how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen dataâ€”all while using real world datasets. I used scikit-learn library.
 
## Course-2: Unsupervised Learning in Python
In this course,I learnt the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and implemented the essential algorithms using scikit-learn and scipy.I learnt how to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets, and ended the course by building a recommender system to recommend popular musical artists.

## Course-3: Linear Classifiers in Python
In this course I learnt all about using linear classifiers, specifically logistic regression and support vector machines, with scikit-learn. I learnt how to train, test, and tune these linear classifiers in Python. 

## Course-4: Machine Learning with Tree-Based Models in Python
Decision trees are supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. Tree models present a high flexibility that comes at a price: on one hand, trees are able to capture complex non-linear relationships; on the other hand, they are prone to memorizing the noise present in a dataset. By aggregating the predictions of trees that are trained differently, ensemble methods take advantage of the flexibility of trees while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. Ensemble methods are used across a variety of fields and have a proven track record of winning many machine learning competitions. In this course,I learnt how to use Python to train decision trees and tree-based models.Understood the advantages and shortcomings of trees and demonstrated how ensembling can alleviate these shortcomings, all while practicing on real-world datasets.

## Course-5: Extreme Gradient Boosting with XGBoost
Gradient boosting is one of the most popular techniques for efficient modeling of tabular datasets of all sizes. XGboost is a very fast, scalable implementation of gradient boosting, with models using XGBoost regularly winning online data science competitions and being used at scale across different industries. In this course, I learnt how to use this powerful library alongside pandas and scikit-learn to build and tune supervised learning models.
