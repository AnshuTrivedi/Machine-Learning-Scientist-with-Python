# This Course consists of four parts which are as:

## 1. Classification
In this chapter,learnt about classification problems and how to solve them using supervised learning techniques. 
political dataset, where in which classified the party affiliation of United States congressmen based on their voting records.
used image and political datasets to predict binary and multiclass outcomes

## 2.Regression
Regression is best suited to continuous ouput problems.Learnt about fundamental concepts in regression and apply them to predict the life expectancy in a given country using Gapminder data.

## 3.Fine-tuning your model
After training model,next task is to evaluate its performance. In this chapter, learnt about some of the other metrics available in scikit-learn to measure model's performance in a more nuanced manner.Learnt to optimize classification and regression models using hyperparameter tuning.

## 4.Preprocessing and pipelines
This chapter introduces pipelines, and how scikit-learn allows for transformers and estimators to be chained together and used as a single unit. Preprocessing techniques will be introduced as a way to enhance model performance, and pipelines will tie together concepts.
