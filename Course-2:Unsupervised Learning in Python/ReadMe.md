# This course consists of four parts which are as:

## 1.Clustering for dataset exploration
Learnt how to discover the underlying groups (or "clusters") in a dataset.I clustered companies using their stock market prices, and distinguishing different species by clustering their measurements.

## 2.Visualization with hierarchical clustering and t-SNE
In this chapter,I learnt about two unsupervised learning techniques for data visualization, hierarchical clustering and t-SNE. Hierarchical clustering merges the data samples into ever-coarser clusters, yielding a tree visualization of the resulting cluster hierarchy. t-SNE maps the data samples into 2d space so that the proximity of the samples to one another can be visualized.

## 3.Decorrelating your data and dimension reduction
Dimension reduction summarizes a dataset using its common occuring patterns. In this chapter, I learnt about the most fundamental of dimension reduction techniques, "Principal Component Analysis" ("PCA"). PCA is often used before supervised learning to improve model performance and generalization. It can also be useful for unsupervised learning. For example, I employed a variant of PCA which allowed me to cluster Wikipedia articles by their content!

## 4.Discovering interpretable features
In this chapter, I learnt about a dimension reduction technique called "Non-negative matrix factorization" ("NMF") that expresses samples as combinations of interpretable parts. For example, it expresses documents as combinations of topics, and images in terms of commonly occurring visual patterns. I learnt to use NMF to build recommender systems that can find similar articles to read, or musical artists that match listening history!
